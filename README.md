# EDA-My-reading-profile

The data for this project comes from my own StoryGraph account. StoryGraph is a platform where you can track your reading and choose your next book, and reding is one of my greatest passions, so I use it quite a lot. <br>

                                                                         3.75, 4.0, 4.25, 4.5, 4.75, 5.0	<br>

 The aim of this project is to clean, analyze and visualize the dataset in a way that would allow me to gain new insights when it comes to my reading preferences, so as to be able to choose books in a more mindful manner in the future.
